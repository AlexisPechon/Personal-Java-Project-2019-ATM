# Personal-Java-Project-2019-ATM
This Java Project was another personal project that was meant to challenge my knowledge on Java during my early stages of programming in 2019. The application makes use of the instantiable class where most of the programming logic and methods resides. The method is then later called in the main app class with the assistance of if statements.
